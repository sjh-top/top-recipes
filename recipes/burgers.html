    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hamburgers are an exceptionally easy meal to make at home for yourself and the family!</p>
    <p>I prefer to make my burgers on my hardwood charcoal fired Big Green Egg but any grill or even a skillet will do.</p>
    <p>This recipe will produce four hamburgers</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>1 onion chopped into slices</li>
        <li>1 head of lettuce split into leaves</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start your grill or oven to medium heat. I usually shoot for around 300-400F</li>
        <li>Split the beef into 4 equal sections and pat into rounds. Place each on on the grill or skillet till browned. Flip after 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Place base of burger bun on the plate and follow with the finished meat, lettuce, onion and a dab of ketchup. Put the bun top on and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
